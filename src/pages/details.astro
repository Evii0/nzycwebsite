                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Jonathan was a man destined for greatness but who submitted faithfully to the hand of God in his life. His life was a tapestry of
                            bravery, sadness, friendship and tragedy. It remains an example of humility, faith, hope and love.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout his life Jonathan enacts a remarkable type of faithful Israel as God’s people who enter into an everlasting covenant of
                            kindness with the Beloved. We also see glimpses of Christ our Saviour and his work of salvation with us.

                            The aim of the conference is to develop the spiritual understanding and commitment of those attending and strengthen friendships
                            around the Word of God. Our fellowship is based on the Word of God and living a life according to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In all ways we must show ourselves to be followers of Christ and so leave behind a good impression that will be a testimony to The
                            Truth and bring glory to God.
                        </p>
